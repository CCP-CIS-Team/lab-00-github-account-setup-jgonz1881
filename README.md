## Why This Lab Matters

GitHub is the professional standard for showcasing your work. Every lab you complete this semester lives here — and when you finish CIS 288, you will have a real cloud portfolio that employers can see.

This lab gets you set up. It is the only one with this many steps. After this, every lab is just 4 commands.

**Estimated time:** 20-30 minutes (first-timers) | 10 minutes (if you have used Git before)

## Step 1 — Create Your GitHub Account

Already have a GitHub account? Skip to Step 2.

3. Use your CCP email (@myCCP.edu) — this matters for GitHub Education benefits
4. Choose a username that looks professional (e.g., firstname-lastname or flastname)
5. Verify your email address

Screenshot required: Your GitHub profile page (github.com/YOUR-USERNAME) showing you are logged in.

2. Click Get Student Benefits
3. Use your CCP email to verify student status
4. This unlocks GitHub Pro for free — private repos, extra storage, and more

## Step 3 — Install Git on Your Computer

Windows:
1. Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Run the installer — accept all defaults
3. Open Command Prompt or Git Bash and confirm:

    git --version

You should see something like: git version 2.x.x

Mac:
    git --version

If not installed, macOS will prompt you to install it automatically.

## Step 4 — Configure Git With Your Identity

Open Command Prompt, Git Bash, or Terminal and run these two commands:

    git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
    git config --global user.email "your-email@myCCP.edu"

Confirm it saved:
    git config --list

## Step 7 — Answer These Questions

Q1: In your own words, what is GitHub and why do developers use it?

    GitHub is a website and platform where developers can store, manage, and share their code online. Developers use it to track changes in projects, work together with teams, and keep backups of their code using version control tools like Git.

Q2: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

   Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes in their code and manage different versions of a project. GitHub is an online platform that uses Git to let developers store code in the cloud, collaborate with others, and share projects easily.

Q3: Why would a future employer look at your GitHub profile?

    A future employer may look at your GitHub profile to see your coding skills, projects, and how much experience you have working with code. It can also show your teamwork, consistency, and ability to use tools like Git and version control in real-world projects.

## Step 8 — Your First Commit and Push

Once you have filled in Steps 6 and 7, save the file and run:

    git add .
    git commit -m "lab00 complete - Your Full Name"
    git push

Then go to your repo on github.com and confirm your answers are visible. If you can see them — you are done.

---

## Screenshots to Attach

Drag these image files into your repo folder, then write the filename next to each item:

| Screenshot | Filename |
|---|---|
| Your GitHub profile page (logged in) | |
| git --version output in terminal | |
| git config --list showing your name and email | |
| Your repo on github.com after pushing | |

## Grading — 20 Points Total

| Item | Points |
|---|---|
| Info table completed | 4 pts |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| git command not found | Install Git from git-scm.com first (Step 3) |
| Permission denied publickey | Use the HTTPS URL not SSH — see Step 5 |
| fatal not a git repository | Make sure you cloned first — see Step 5 |
| Push asks for username/password | Use your GitHub username + a Personal Access Token as the password. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens |
| Cannot find your repo URL | Check your email for the GitHub Classroom invite or ask Professor Chang |
